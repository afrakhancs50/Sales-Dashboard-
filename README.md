**SALES DASHBOARD**

**Project Overview:**

This project involved creating a sales dashboard by extracting and manipulating data from a SQL database, followed by visualizing the insights using Power BI. The dashboard provides a clear overview of key sales metrics, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

**My Contributions:**

Data Importing & SQL Queries:

Extracted and processed sales data from a SQL database using advanced SQL queries such as JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING to retrieve and aggregate key sales metrics.

Data Cleansing & Manipulation:

Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. This involved handling missing data, correcting erroneous entries, and formatting the data for smooth integration with Power BI.

Data Aggregation & Analysis:

Performed data aggregation in SQL to calculate key metrics like total sales, sales by category, and top-performing products. Used SQL functions and subqueries to enhance data analysis.

**Power BI Dashboard Design:**

Designed and built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize key metrics such as sales trends, regional performance, top products, and customer demographics. Incorporated slicers and filters for a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

**Technologies Used:**

SQL: For data extraction, manipulation, and analysis from the database.
Power BI: For creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
